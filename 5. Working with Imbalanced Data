# Our model needs to take each row of features and make a prediction of whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.
# A simple feed-forward neural network is a good fit for this. It performs a multitude of mathematical calculations on each input row.
# The parameters of each of these calculations are what end up getting tuned during training.
# This model will be built in Keras, which is a user-friendly deep learning API on top of TensorFlow.
